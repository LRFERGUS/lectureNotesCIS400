Milestone 7 due Friday

See Monday's notes for a suggested order of approach

////////////////////////////

Burger customization.

- just ONE control to use for all burgers
- customize cheese, patties, veggie

--> how to display the cheeses?

<ComboBox ... ItemsSource="{Binding CheeseOptions}" SelectedItem="{Binding CheeseChoice}"

--> in MainWindow, how to tell if we should display burger
    customization?

have an event handler with our custom event args, custom event args has
    the menu item as a property 

    if menu item was Burger, display the burger customization control 






///////////////////////////

Ice cream / drink customization.

--> if you want, *can* create a helper control with shared info
    e.g., decaf/iced/size for drinks 

    and then place it on a custom control

///////////////////////////

How to make Order properties change when items are customized?

in Order's Add:

item.PropertyChanged += HandlePropertyChanged;


--> then what to do? 

private void HandlePropertyChanged(object sender, PropertyChangedEventArgs e) {
    if (e.PropertyName == "Price") {
        //now Order invoke PropertyChanged for Subtotal, Tax, Total 
    }
}



--> what to do in Remove, Clear? 

item.PropertyChanged -= HandlePropertyChanged;



///////////////////////////////

What if your drink/ice cream used a dictionary of toppings?

Coffee, for example

maybe in Drink, inner DrinkIngredient class with an Included property

maybe in Drink, Dictionary<AddOnType, DrinkIngredient> AddOns


1) In Coffee class, make a property for each customizable add-on
    that interacts with this dictionary. Like this for cream:

public bool Cream
{
    get => AddOns[AddOnType.Cream].Included; //(basically, return the “included” value for the dictionary entry corresponding to cream)
    set
    {
        //change the included value corresponding to this add-on
        AddOns[AddOnType.Cream].Included = value;
        
        //now, invoke PropertyChanged for each property that is impacted
        //by cream changing
    }
}

In coffee customization control
    for cream: check box, Checked="{Binding Cream}"
