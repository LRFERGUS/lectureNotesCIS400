static vs non-static.

    --> when can/should a field/method/property be static?
        field/property: same value shared across all instances
        method: want to call the method without creating an object
            (library methods)


    --> when is a field/method/property NOT allowed to be static?
        field: (most of the time, not static) when I want to store a different
            value for different instances
        property/method: if they use a member (like a field) that is NOT static



    --> when should a class be static?
        when all the fields/properties/methods are also static


-------------------------------------------------

Encapsulation - what is this?
    identifying elements we're representing and putting their information and
    operations in one place
