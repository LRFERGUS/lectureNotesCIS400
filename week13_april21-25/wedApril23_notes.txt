Milestone 10: due Friday


Recommended order of approach:
- Add About page and edit Privacy page
- Write the static Menu class (DairyBarn.Data)
- Write the index page to get the menu information to *appear*
- Testing
- UML
- Styling

//////////////////////////////////


Testing: static Menu class

For each type of menu item (Burgers, IceCream, Drinks):
    1) Test that the count matches your expectations
        
    --> include documentation explaining how you got the number you did

    //classic: 2 cheese, 3 patties, 2 veggie, total: 12 
    //other burgers
    //total: 12 + .... = (some number)

    Assert.Equal(some number, the collection's count)


    2) For Burgers/ice cream:
        3 checks for specific "edge case" menu items that SHOULD be in the menu
        3 checks for specific "edge case" menu items that should NOT be in the menu

    3) For drinks:
        3 chese for specific customized menu items that SHOULD be in the menu


////////////////////////////////

Assert.Contains(collection, item => (some bool expression about item));


Example: make sure "Drinks" contains a tall iced decaf coffee with cream and no sugar

Assert.Contains(Menu.Drinks, item => item is Coffee c && c.Iced && c.Decaf
                                    && c.Cream && !c.Sugar && c.SizeChoice == CoffeeSize.Tall )





Assert.DoesNotContain(collection, item => (some bool expression about item));

Example: make sure "Burgers" does NOT contain a veggie burger with non-veggie patties

Assert.DoesNotContain(Menu.Burgers, item => item is VeggieBurger v && !v.Veggie);



Would this work? not unless you override ==

Assert.Contains(Menu.Drinks, item => item == new Coffee(){...});


///////////////////////////////

Not required to test BurgerToppings collection


///////////////////////////////

Loop through enumerations (example, CoffeeSize): 

foreach (CoffeeSize c in Enum.GetValues<CoffeeSize>()) {

}




///////////////////////////////

UML:

- add static Menu class (namespace? DairyBarn.Data)
    how to show static? underline (class name and all the properties)
    any "has-a" relationships? 
        has a bunch of IMenuItem - aggregation (diamond on Menu)
        has a bunch BurgerIngredient




- add each page (Index, Privacy, About) and mark the new namespace
    - look in each PageModel (code-behind) to see any properties/members
    - look for inheritance information




--> relationship between Menu and Index page?
    directed association
    point from Index to Menu



--> don't need Program.cs, Error.cshthml.cs, _Layout.cshtml, ViewImports.cshtml



/////////////////////////

Styling the menu items.

Suggestion: have div around burgers, ice cream, drinks sections

have a div around each menu item


css for burgers/ice cream/drinks
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;


css for menu item (gives length to item)
    flex-basis: 200px;
    border: (set to something)
