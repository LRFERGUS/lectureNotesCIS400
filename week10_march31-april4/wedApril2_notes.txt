Milestone 8 due Friday

/////////////////////////

"Add to Pick Two" button in burger control

--> want to hide if it is already part of a pick two


/////////////////////////

Data validation in WPF


<TextBox>
    <TextBox.Text>
        <Binding Path="SomePropertyName" Delay="500" UpdateSourceTrigger="PropertyChanged">
            <Binding.ValidationRules>
                <ExceptionValidationRule/>
            </Binding.ValidationRules>
        </Binding>
    </TextBox.Text>
</TextBox>


Idea: will put red marker around the TextBox if setting the property causes
    an exception (could be your own exception, or could be exception from trying
    to convert input to the property type)


Default "UpdateSourceTrigger" for a TextBox is when it loses focus
    --> we want to apply our data validation whenever the property changes
        (i.e., as the user types), so we make it be "PropertyChanged"

    --> the delay waits the given amount (here, 500ms) before setting the property
        (lets the user finish typing)



/////////////////////////

--> see similar example

--> what if we wanted the cost to show as $0.00 for an invalid #shirts?



/////////////////////////
