Sections in memory:

- static
- stack
- heap


--> What goes on each part?


--> Can static variables change?  
Can static memory size change? 


Memory leak issues?




--> When does stack grow and shrink? 
Is stack limited in size? 
    
    Is memory for ALL value types on the stack?

--> how could we create this? What happens in memory?


--> does it make a difference if "p" is a field/property vs a local variable?


////////////////////////

enums.

public enum SomeName 
{
    Value1, Value2, ...
}



--> are really ints (0, 1, 2, ...). Can be cast to ints in this way.


public enum Soda
{
    Sprite,
    DrPepper,
    DietCoke,
    Coke   
}

--> declare an enum variable, set to Sprite




--> print it (use an interpolated string). What prints?




--> what if it had the value DrPepper? What would print?

--> how to loop through all enum values?
