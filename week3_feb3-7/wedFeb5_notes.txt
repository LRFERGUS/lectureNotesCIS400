Milestone 2 due Friday.


Add 5 new enums:
    Type of cheese
    Size of coffee drink
    Type of ice cream cone
    Type of ice cream mix-in
    Type of ice cream sauce
    (why use enums instead of strings?)

Each burger has cheese/patties properties (1-2 or 1-3)
    constraints?
    what other properties are affected?
    what to do with bool cheese properties?

Each sundae has a sauce/scoops properties
    constraints?
    what other properties are affected?
    what to do with bool sauce properties?

Ice cream cone has scoops and cone type 
    what other properties are affected?

New classes: Mocha, Latte, WinterSwirl

All coffee items have a size
    scaling?
