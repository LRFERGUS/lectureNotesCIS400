DataContext - what data the user interface is displaying

What is the data again? Where to set DataContext?
    in MainWindow constructor

How to write click event handler? in menu selection code-behind

    private void MenuItemClick(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) {
        //figure out which button was clicked
        if (sender is Button b) {
            if (DataContext is ObservableCollection<IMenuItem> list) {
                if (b.Name == "BYOButton") {
                    list.Add(new BYOBurger());
                }
            }
        }
            

        //add a menu item corresponding to that button to my DataContext
    }


How to set the click event handler?

<Button Name="BYOButton"... Click="MenuItemClick">Build-Your-Own Burger</Button

////

Overriding ToString
    just override in Burger, IceCream, Drink, PickTwo

////

Updating UML
    each window/user control becomes a box in the UML

    MainWindow HAS A (composition) menu selection control and HAS AN order summary control
        diamond touches MainWindow, mult. 1 to 1

    MainWindow extends System.Windows.Window
        make box for System.Windows.Window
        solid line, arrow pointing to System.Windows.Window

    similarly, user controls

    add ToString to the base classes in the data library

    show that MainWindow HAS A collection of IMenuItem
        diamond on MainWindow, mult. 1 to (0..*) IMenuItem

    need to indicate TWO projects: Data, PointOfSale:
        1) one big page, use "package" uml label 
            put as big border around all Data classes, label DairyBarn.Data
            similar, different package label for DairyBarn.PointOfSale
        2) OR, add a second page. Label first page DairyBarn.Data,
            second page DairyBarn.PointOfSale


how show that MainWindow HAS A collection of IMenuItem
    copy IMenuItem, paste it next to MainWindow
    relabel IMenuItem as DairyBarn.Data.IMenuItem

////

Testing ToString

in every menu item unit test file, add a Fact for testing ToString:

    Assert.Equal("whatever ", obj.ToString());

    (or use obj.Name)
