This week:
- Today: WPF tutorial
    - build a GUI
    - edit controls

- Tuesday: Resources and styles tutorial 
    - add customization to all controls of a certain type
    - kind of like CSS

- Milestone 5:
    - Write shell of GUI for the "point of sale" for Dairy Barn
    - Clicking menu items should add them to the order display

//////////////////////////

WPF applications consist of:
- MainWindow (this is what launches when your program starts)
- A collection of UserControls that are placed on the MainWindow
    or within another UserControl

- Controls are laid out in layouts. Most common:
    --> Grid - grids/columns
    --> StackPanel - puts things in a column or in a row
    --> DockPanel - dock other elements to top/bottom/left/right
        last added or undocked element will fill any remaining space

When to use each?



Most common library controls:
    - Button
    - TextBlock (just to put text on the screen)
    - TextBox (user input)
    - ListView 
    (later we will have check boxes, radio buttons, etc.)


How to customize appearance?

/////////////////////////

Starting Milestone 5.
    --> how to add a new project?
    --> how to change the startup project?


Look at sample GUI picture

See demo


///////////////////////////

--> some functionality will be missing for now.
    - Order subtotal/total/tax being correctly displayed
    - Being able to edit menu items
    - Displaying more information about items than just the name
    - Back to Menu / Cancel Order / Complete Order buttons

//////

Creating menu control
    - what kind of layout?
    - what kind of controls will you have?
    - do you need to worry about spacing of other components?



/////

Creating order control
    - what kind of layout?
    - what kinds of controls will you have?
    


////

Creating the MainWindow.
    - how to lay out the menu and the order summary?
    - how to get the buttons on the bottom?

    Adding a custom control:

    <local:YourControlClass/>

    (can specify properties like Grid.Row, etc. as usual)


////

What is DataContext? How does it work?

    where data comes from that the user interface is displaying


Order control should contain a ListView
    - what should our DataContext be?


In your MainWindow constructor:

    DataContext = new ObservableCollection<IMenuItem>();


click event handler for buttons:

<Button Name="CheeseBurgerButton" Click="NameOfEventHandler" ... />


In click event handler:

if (DataContext is ObservableCollection<IMenuItem> list) {
    list.Add(...)

}




    What does the "Binding" mean?
