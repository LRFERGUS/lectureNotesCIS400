"Data binding" in Razor pages

Use a form to transfer data from browser to PageModel

Forms have different input elements, notably:
    text
    number
    radio button 
    check box 
    submit (a button that submits the form)


<form>
    <input type="text" value="I have text"/>
    ...
    <input type="submit" value="Submit Form"/>
</form>


Clicking the submit button calls the OnGet method in the PageModel




(form elements also have name, placeholder, min / max (for number type) attributes


/////////////////////////////

Data binding in Razor pages

- bind an HTML form element to a property in the PageModel

<input type="text" name = "MyString" value="@Model.MyString"/>



In PageModel:

[BindProperty(SupportsGet = true)]
public string MyString { get; set; }


//////////////////////////////

Example: see initial form Example

--> how to bind to a string property?


--> what should we do in OnGet? When is OnGet first called?



--> what happens if we try to add each element to a list in PageModel?
    what happens to the list?


//////////////////////////////

Milestone 11:

--> add form with filters by calories (low/high), price (low/high), keywords



For keywords: split into separate strings

You have a match of all the strings are contained in either:
    - name
    - description
    - preparation information



Example: "tall iced coffee"


tall (non-iced) coffee?
tall mocha?

//////////////////////////////////

How to display filtered results?

In your Menu class, make a FullMenu property that includes all burgers,
    ice cream, drinks




///////////////////////

Also in Menu class, add filtering methods:
1) Filter by price
2) Filter by calories
3) Filter by keywords

parameters: list/IEnumerable of menu items to search, search criteria
return: list/IEnumerable of menu items that match the criteria


initially, pass in the full menu (to the first filter)
pass the result of the previous filter to the next filter
    (and so on)

remember that any of the search criteria might be null


Feel free to add extra helper methods/classes/properties as needed


///////////////////////////

You will likely want to add additional properties to your Index PageModel

(FilterResults, Burgers, Drinks, IceCream)

Wednesday: discuss LINQ queries, testing, UML updates

price/calories: recommend using LINQ queries

keyword: *can* do with a LINQ query, but recommend just a manual approach
