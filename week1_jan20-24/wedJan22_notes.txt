CIS 400: Object-oriented design, implementation, and testing

Julie Thornton


-----------------------------------------------------------

What will we learn? 
    Creating and maintaining a large software project

1) Object-oriented development principles
2) Desktop development using WPF, data binding, and custom events 
3) Web development using ASP.NET, web forms, and LINQ

Throughout course: writing unit tests, creating UML diagrams





--> big project: developing menu, point of sale, website for Dairy Barn

    Part 1: develop menu using object-oriented design principles
    Part 2: write point of sale WPF application for restaurant
    Part 3: create website for restaurant using ASP.NET



--> see the project from last semester

-----------------------------------------------------------

Course structure - hybrid.

- Module of work each week (posted each Friday):
    - reading
    - maybe, a quiz or 2 (not for points, but recommended!)
    - 2 video tutorials (will start next week - due Mon/Tues)
    - new milestone for the semester-long project (due Fri)

    - this week is a little different




What will we do during class time?
    Mondays: lecture/recitation over current material

    Wednesdays: (whatever is left), talk about current milestone,
        get help if needed

    Fridays: help time




----------------------------------------------------------

Software needed.

- Visual Studio 2022 (disable IntelliCode) and Visio 
    (can use another UML tool)

    --> might need to update Visual Studio (find the Visual Studio installer)



- How to get free versions of both?


- Mac users




- Lab machines




----------------------------------------------------------

Graded work.

Exams (2 midterms, 1 optional final):   35%
Milestones (about 12):                  50%
Tutorials:                              15%


Grading scale: 90/80/70/60


Borderline grades.







-----------------------------------------------------------

Class policies.

- Late work
    milestones are due each Friday
    late milestone lose 10% each day they are late 
        bottom threshold of 40% 
    all previous work turned in by the Friday after an exam

    same for tutorials (Mon/Tues)
    

- Final exam is optional
    --> can use it to replace your lowest midterm, if it helps you



- Incomplete



- Collaboration
    tutorials: if you want?
    milestones: should be your own work


- No AI-generated code or IntelliCode use


- Getting help
    --> Ed Discussion
    --> Helping hand extra credit

-----------------------------------------------------------

Course materials.

- Canvas (see syllabus and modules)


- Online textbook


- Weekly summary page



--> See any typos? Bug bounty.






------------------------------------------------------------

THIS week:
    - Milestone 0 due Fri (finish reading / quiz beforehand!)
        - practice milestone process (git, create release)
        - PLUS, post on Ed Discussion (can do this now)



------------------------------------------------------------

Consider the following Person class:

public class Person {
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }

    //default constructor: public Person() {}
}
 

Create two Person objects â€“ pers1
    pers1: John Doe, age 40

//ONE WAY
Person pers1 = new Person();
pers1.Name = "John Doe";
pers1.Age = 40;

/ANOTHER WAY
Person pers1 = new() {Name = "John Doe", Age = 40};

///////

Add a property to Person called "Classification" that is ALWAYS "Person"

public string Classification {get;} = "Person";

OR:

public string Classification => "Person";


Add a property to Person called Info that gets a List<string> of:
    Person's name 
    Either "minor" or "adult", based on age


public List<string> Info
{
    get
    {
        List<string> list = new();
        list.Add(Name);

        if (Age < 18) list.Add("minor");
        else list.Add("adult");

        return list;
    }
}

foreach(string s in pers1.Info) 
{
    Console.WriteLine(s);
}

double type - a number with a decimal
decimal type - a number with a decimal (currency)

decimal type, literals

decimal val = 5.0m;


uint type - unsigned integer

things that should never be negative

////////

Experience with git? Command line? Branches? Merging? 
Multiple "local" repos?


--> who will use multiple machines to work?

--> who will use lab machines?

//////////

Stopped here

//////////

Overall idea of git.

- have a remote repository (this is the URL you copy from GitHub before you clone)
- can have one or many local repositories on different computers
    - each local repository is connected to the remote repository
    - the remote repository is the "origin"
    - each local repository will have a record of the active branch ("HEAD")
    

--> different local repositories might have different "HEAD" values


--> as you checkout different branches in your local repo, the code on the computer
    will change. This does NOT mean you've lost your other code.


--> if you made changes to a local branch, you must make a commit and PUSH it
    to the corresponding remote branch


--> if there are changes in a remote branch, you must PULL them into 
    the corresponding local branch



////////////////

When you sit down to work:

    git status

--> see what branch you are on
--> see if you have any local changes (commit them if you do and want to keep them)


Pull changes from the corresponding remote branch:

    git pull

(will need to set upstream in configurations initially. Can also do:
git pull origin <branchName>)


(git pull only pulls from the current branch. Will need to separately pull
or checkout other branches, if needed.)

To get ALL remote branches:

    git fetch

Then you can checkout the desired branch, and it will automatically track 
    origin/branchName

///////////////

When you take a break, commit and push changes to current branch:

    git add .
    git commit -m "describe your changes"
    git push

(will need to set upstream in configurations initially. Can also do:

    git push -u origin <branchName>

the -u creates a new remote branch with the same if that branch is new. Isn't
needed if the branch already exists, but doesn't hurt.)

/////////////

See quick example with git branches

/////////////

Other tips:

- commit and push a LOT!
- stay on a milestone branch until you are completely done. Only then do
    you want to merge it into main

--> make sure your project builds!
--> download, extract, open, and build/run the release when you finish

////////////

Friday: 
- help on Milestone 0
    --> I recommend you start it before Friday so you can come to class with questions
    --> we can check to make sure you did the right thing with git/branches/release
