--> This is one of the more time-consuming milestones. Start early!

//////////////////////////

Exam 1: Wednesday, February 26


Next week will have a different structure:
    - No tutorials or milestones
    - Review on Monday
    - Exam 1 on Wednesday
    - Work day Friday
    - ALL past due assignments must be submitted by Friday, Feb 28
        for any partial credit

After the exam, we will start on WPF (to make the UI)

//////////////////////////////

Today:
- Tiny bit on nullables 
- Milestone 4 tests
- Milestone 4 UML

//////////////////////////////

Nullables

public List<string> MyList {get; set;}


--> what if you got a compiler warning about nullables?

--> how to fix?

Tests for Milestone 4.

Do first: specific required tests



- should have a separate test class for each non-abstract menu item
    1) test default values for all properties whose value can change
        (except you don't have to test prep info defaults)


    2) test any bounds/constraints for properties -- make sure you CAN 
        change those properties to a *good* value, and that you CAN'T
        change them to a *bad* value



    3) test each derived property based on possible configurations


    4) test IsAssignableFrom with IMenuItem, base class



/////////////////////////////////////////

Example: ClassicCheeseburger
    ketchup, mustard, pickles, onions - included
    bacon, lettuce, tomato - not included
    American cheese
    non-veggie
    1 patty


    1) what to do for defaults test?




    2) which derived properties to test? what kinds of test cases? 
        
        Parameters:

        what should you choose for inline data?
            





        --> preparation information?
        


    3) how to test bounds? 


//////////////////////////////////////

Order tests: use mock objects
    new properties: TaxRate, Subtotal, Total, Tax


    Defaults:




    Derived properties:



    private class MockMenuItem : IMenuItem {
        //list all things from interface

        public decimal Price { get; set; }
    }

BYOBurger tests:
    all ingredients are possible

    configuration instead of bools. pass BurgerTopping[]

UML for Milestone 4.

Relationships:
    Realization (is-a):
        what for?
        looks like?
        where used?


    Generalization (is-a):
        what for? 
        looks like?
        where used?


    Aggregation (has-a): 
        what for? 
        looks like?
        where used?
        multiplicities?


    Composition (has-a):
        what for? 
        looks like?
        where used?
        multiplicities?
