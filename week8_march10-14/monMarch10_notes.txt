Data binding part 1: due tonight
    (NOTE: there is a mistake when handling remove in the tutorial
    - read the Canvas assignment for the correction)

Data binding part 2: due Tuesday

Milestone 6: due Friday

--> I'll post the week 9 module on Friday *just in case*
    you want to work over spring break

    (none of it is due until the week after spring break)


///////////////////////////////////

Note: MS 4 grading is delayed (sorry!!), should be done by Friday

///////////////////////////////////

See MS 6 demo.


Milestone 6 summary:

- Use Order as DataContext (requires some changes to Order)
- Display name and price of each menu item in the order summary
- Subtotal/tax/total are automatically updated as items are added
- Cancel order is implemented
- Remove item is implemented

//////////////////////////////////

Data binding.

Idea: front end display is bound to back end data. Changing one changes both.



- Controls have a DataContext
- an attribute in a control can be bound to a property in the control's DataContext


In a control, can do something like:
    Text = "{Binding PropertyName}"

    or:
        Text = "{Binding Path=PropertyName}"


    or (if DataContext is an IEnumerable):
        ItemsSource="{Binding}"


--> control will see if its DataContext has property called PropertyName
    --> if it does, it displays PropertyName
    --> if it doesn't, it displays nothing (no errors)



Remember that different controls *can* have different DataContexts.

If they don't define their own, they "inherit" the DataContext of the
    control they were added to


//////////////////////////////////

Number property.

- Want first order to be 1

- Next order to be 2

- Etc.


Solution:

    private static uint _nextOrderNumber = 1;
    private uint _orderNumber = _nextOrderNumber++;
    public uint Number => _orderNumber;

Order o = new();
Console.WriteLine(o.Number);
Console.WriteLine(o.Number);
Console.WriteLine(o.Number);

Order o2 = new();




//////////////////////////////////

PlacedAt property.
    - Type is DateTime
    - get-only
    - initialize to *now* (DateTime.Now)


How to write?

public DateTime PlacedAt {get;} = DateTime.Now;





//////////////////////////////////

INotifyCollectionChanged interface
    public event NotifyCollectionChangedEventHandler? CollectionChanged;


This is an *event handler*

We can invoke CollectionChanged when the contents of a collection change 
    - when a collection is bound to a ListView, WPF automatically listens
        for CollectionChanged events
    - it attaches its own handler to CollectionChanged, which contains code 
        to redraw the GUI


CollectionChanged?.Invoke(...)

    - see Data Binding Tutorial 1
    

public class Order : INotifyCollectionChanged  ... {


}


--> when does the collection itself change? Order's Add, Remove, Clear


////////////////////////////

What to do in PointOfSale?


In MainWindow: 
    constructor set DataContext to an Order

    click event handler for cancel order button
    XAML: Click = "Something" (cancel button)
    Code-behind: 
        private void Something(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) {
            //get DataContext as an Order
            //call Clear on the Order
        }



In Order summary XAML:
    order number / time stamp / subtotal/ tax / total are coming from Order

    <TextBlock Text="{Binding PlacedAt, StringFormat='Date: {0}'}"/>


    <TextBlock Text="{Binding Subtotal, StringFormat='{}{0:C}'}"/>


    <ListView ItemsSource="{Binding}"/>


In menu selection code-behind:

click event for menu items

now: if (DataContext is ObservableCollection<IMenuItem> list)
change to looking for new DataContext


///////////////////////////

Displaying name/price/remove capability of each item in Order Summary:

<ListView HorizontalContentAlignment="Stretch" ItemsSource="{Binding}">
    <ListView.ItemTemplate>
        <DataTemplate>
            <StackPanel>
                //now have TextBlock for item's name, price
                <TextBlock Text="{Binding Name}"/>

                //have remove button
                <Button Click="HandleRemove">Remove</Button>

            </StackPanel>
        </DataTemplate>
    </ListView.ItemTemplate>
</ListView>





//////////////////////////

Write the remove click event handler in order summary code-behind:

private void HandleRemove(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) {
    //remove the item associated with this button from
    //the order

    DataContext
}



What is DataContext? Order

What is sender? the specific remove button that was clicked

What is sender's DataContext? the menu item corresponding to the remove
    convert sender to a button, then get its DataContext


How to remove? convert DataContext to an Order, call remove
    with that menu item

On Wednesday: 
- Implementing INotifyPropertyChange
- UML changes
- Testing changes
